## üì± Project Overview

This application helps charity workers efficiently manage and track candy box distributions across multiple locations. The system tracks how long each location has had the same boxes and provides simple tools to reset timers when boxes are changed, ensuring fresh supplies reach children who need them.

### Platform Architecture

- **Mobile App**: Primary Android application for field workers (iOS coming soon)
- **Backend API**: Next.js 14 with PostgreSQL database and Google Maps integration
- **Web Platform**: Simple landing page with app store download links

### Key Features

- **Elapsed Time Tracking**: Show how long ago boxes were last changed at each location (e.g., "5 days ago", "2 weeks ago")
- **One-Button Reset**: Simple "Mark as Changed" button to restart elapsed time tracking
- **Route Optimization**: Calculate the most efficient routes using Google Maps API
- **Location Management**: Add and manage multiple distribution locations with GPS coordinates
- **Visual Status Indicators**: Color-coded alerts based on elapsed time (green < 7 days, red ‚â• 7 days)
- **Offline Functionality**: Android app works without internet for remote locations
- **Real-time Sync**: Automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored

### Problem Statement

Charity workers need to efficiently manage candy box distribution across multiple locations. The main challenges include:

- **Tracking Freshness**: Knowing exactly how long ago candy boxes were changed at each location
- **Route Planning**: Efficiently visiting locations that need box changes based on elapsed time
- **Simple Updates**: Easy way for field workers to mark when boxes are changed
- **Remote Access**: Working in areas with limited internet connectivity
- **Resource Optimization**: Prioritizing locations based on elapsed time since last change

### Solution Approach

KuyaBasti's innovative platform provides:
1. **Elapsed Time System**: Automatic tracking showing "X days ago" since boxes were last changed
2. **Simple Mobile Interface**: One-button solution designed for field workers
3. **Smart Route Optimization**: Google Maps integration for efficient multi-location visits
4. **Visual Status System**: Color-coded interface showing elapsed time and priority levels
5. **Offline-First Design**: Mobile app functions without internet connection

## üìä Core API Endpoints

### Location Management
```
GET    /api/locations              # Get all locations with elapsed time
POST   /api/locations              # Create new location
POST   /api/locations/[id]/mark-changed  # Reset elapsed time (core feature)
```

### Route Optimization
```
POST   /api/routes/optimize        # Calculate optimal visiting route
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "location-123",
    "name": "Downtown Food Bank",
    "address": "123 Main St, Detroit, MI",
    "elapsedDays": 5,
    "status": "fresh",
    "lastChangeFormatted": "5 days ago"
  }
}
```
